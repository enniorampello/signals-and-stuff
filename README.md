# Signal analysis and processing

## Introduction
This is a useful library to experiment and perform simulations on signals. It is thought to make the course of _Signal analysis and processing_ a bit more interesting and stimulating (:D).

## Guide
Here are some useful pieces of information about what's in this project:
- Inside the file `signals.py` there is a collection of real and complex signals.
- In `signal_ops.py` there are all the main operations to gather information about the signals.
- In `examples.py` there are some useful snippets to understand how to use the library.
- `try.py` is a junk file used to make experiments.

##TODOs

- [ ] Implement Fourier series approximation
